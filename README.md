# This repo is a collection of some basic Python scripts.

Some of these are answers to exercises from Code Wars or Python morsels exercises. 

# temp.py

Prints a different message depending on the argument that is passed to temp_func in the command line.
This should be a temperature in farenheit. 

For example, temp_func(81) will return "Too hot", temp_func(62) will return 'Quite nice'.

# text_split.py

This script defines several functions for counting words in a string.
Regular expressions to remove punctuation and return counts of each word.

The top_3_words function will return the top three most common words.

# time_format.py

The format_duration function will take a time in seconds and return it in a readable format. 

For example, format_duration(123) returns "2 minutes and 3 seconds"
